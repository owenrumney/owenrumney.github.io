    <h2>Delving in the depths of my github</h2>
    <p>16 Feb 2019 - Owen Rumney</p>
</div>

<div class="post-content">
<p>This morning I was trying to solve an issue where http://owenrumney.co.uk has an SSL error when trying to access my blog but https://www.owenrumney.co.uk is fine! (its still not resolved).</p>

<p>As I was poking around in my github account I looked at what I had done over the years… taking me back to 2012 when I originally opened my account.</p>

<p>The first project was an implementation of the LightsOut game written in NodeJS. Since I’ve never had a contract where I’ve been doing Node I can only assume i was writing this to learn Express/NodeJS etc.</p>

<p>The game is simple, click on the lights till they all go out, but when you click a cell, the state of the horizontal and vertical adjacent cells toggle their state.</p>

<p><img src="../images/lightsout.png" alt="LightsOut Gam" /></p>

<p>Even a cursory look at the code has highlighted that it isn’t great, but my thoughts are more about how great it is to have Github and source control systems as a whole. Over the years, my laptops have been changed, flattened, stolen and lost, yet all I needed was a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git clone git@github.com:owenrumney/Lightsout.git</code> and I was able to run (confession, I also had to install node) my inagural GitHub contribution.</p>

<p>‘Int Git Brilliant!!!</p>

<p>(Another confession - it seems you just need to click the middle cell of the lights on start to win the game in a single click - so more work needed ;) )</p>
