<div class="post-content">
<p>Now I’ve got into the Azure platform I’ve decided to start making the most of the MSDN voucher I get for free credits.
, I am a serial “new project” creator, some of these projects make it as far as being interesting to look at and some don’t. Rather than hosting them on a hugely underutilised and time/effort intensive 1&amp;1 VPS, I’ve decided to host them under Azure. This is not least because I can deploy pretty much anything I would want to without the overhead of configuring it.</p>

<p>So, to start with… there is constant reminder…</p>

<h2 id="constant-reminder">Constant Reminder</h2>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>Constant reminder is a Chrome only web application to leverage the notification functionality provided in the Chrome browser.</p>

<p>Once notifications have been activated using the link at the top of the page, you can create time specific or interval based reminders. For example <a href="http://constantreminder.pet-projects.co.uk/?r=Drink+some+water&amp;w=e&amp;e=45&amp;i=mins">Drink some water every 45mins</a></p>

<p>Link: <a href="http://constantreminder.pet-projects.co.uk">constantreminder.pet-projects.co.uk</a></p>
