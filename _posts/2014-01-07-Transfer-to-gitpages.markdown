Not too long ago I [moved my website]({% post_url 2013-09-27-new-blog-new-platform %}) to a static page structure using [Sandra.Snow](https://github.com/sandra/sandra.snow).
At the time, I was aware that it was based on the idea of [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) with a Microsoft lilt using Nancy to
generate the static files.

As a long time Microsoft user it made sense for me to use this approach rather than fighting with Windows to get a
working installation of Ruby and the required dependencies.

Now, with my recent [Windows to Linux transition]({% post_url 2014-01-02-Windows-to-Linux %}) I have the
reverse problem. I can no long easily maintain my blog using Sandra.Snow so I'm looking to Jekyll as a solution. The
process of using git pages to host the website and the steps for managing the DNS required to get up and running with
your own domain name pointing to it are both pretty straight forward. The detailed instructions on github and the
jekyll website are enough to get going.
