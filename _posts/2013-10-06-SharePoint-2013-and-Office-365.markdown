Since starting to use Azure more and more I've found myself revisiting suddenly enthused by the web and cloud. I've had the obligatory Amazon free tier but done little with it. (I've recently talked with Amazon about a project at work where I learned quite a lot about glacier and spot instance pricing and it sounds great - I'll write a post about that shortly).

I'm working on a project doing some initial SharePoint customisation for a customer with an Office 365 account for the company. It's been a little while since I did SharePoint and I have needed to refresh myself on what is available out of the box, what the development model is like for 365 and how to actually deploy... I'm at early stages but I'm very impressed.

I have always been a fan of SharePoint, often defending its virtues to collegues who generally don't understand what it's capable of.... I'm looking forward to learning more about it in the coming weeks.
