An interesting chain of events happened last week; [@thecodejunkie](http://twitter.com/thecodejunkie) relaunched his blog, I happen to follow his twitter feed and he happened to mention it.

The chain continued, I followed the link to his blog for a look and read the post there, [I am back and this time I am taking control](http://thecodejunkie.com/2013/09/10/i-am-back-and-this-time-i-am-taking-control/), the content struck a chord about claiming back a blog.

My interest was further piqued by my new found use of Azure and the static generation method discussed in the article.

I forked [Sandra.Snow](https://github.com/sandra/sandra.snow) on github and plugged away deploying the sample solution and asking questions till I got it working... thanks to [@PhillipHaydon](https://twitter.com/philliphaydon) for quickly helping me out.

Interestingly enough, the thing I've found most enjoyable about the whole process is learning about Markdown... Other than the odd stackoverflow post, I had not had any use for it. Now, I'm sitting on the train with Sublime Text 2 open and I can quickly write my post in relatively clear text, which is awesome!
