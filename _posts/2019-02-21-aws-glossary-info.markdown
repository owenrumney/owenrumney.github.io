Yesterday I created a scraper for the AWS documentation landing page to give an aws glossary of all of the services that have available documentation.

Originally I posted it as a page in this site, I've now moved it to [https://tools.owenrumney.co.uk/aws/index.html](https://tools.owenrumney.co.uk/aws/index.html)
