I have had an on/off relationship with Kubernetes for a number of years and want to spend some time really getting to know how to use it, run it and secure it.

I previously wrote some [Anisble playbooks](https://github.com/owenrumney/local_k8s) to run Kubernetes on my desktop then chatting to [@alistair_hey](https://twitter.com/alistair_hey) about running a local environment on my fairly underpowered laptop he suggested [k3d](https://k3d.io/v5.4.1/) ... so the journey starts here.

## Prerequisites

k3d is a wrapper for [k3s](https://github.com/rancher/k3s) but runs the cluster in Docker. This means that you will need Docker running on the machine (which I already have!). A quick solution is [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) which is very accessible or you can install it using the instructions for your OS and Architecture.

I will be using `kubectl` later to interact with the cluster, so this is also required.

## Getting Started

### Install kubectl

As I am running on Linux I will use the installation instructions for [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)

The first step is to pull the latest binary from `dl.k8s.io`.

```bash
cd ~/Downloads

curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
```

Now I have this, I want to check against the checksum file

```
cd ~/Downloads
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl.sha256"
```

I use the checksums file to validate the binary is as it should be

```bash
echo "$(cat kubectl.sha256)  kubectl" | sha256sum --check
```

Assuming I were told it was `kubectl: OK` I can continue to install.

```bash
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

Lets now check the install was good

```bash
kubectl version --short=true
```

which should give me output similar to 

```bash
Client Version: v1.23.4
Server Version: v1.22.7+k3s1
```

### Installing k3d

First step is to install k3d - I don't like using `wget` or `curl` with install scripts from GitHub so I'm am going to be using the assets from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/k3d-io/k3d/releases).

I am using Ubuntu on a x64 machine so I need to download `k3d-linux-amd64`

> Note I'm using v5.4.1 at the time of writing

Once I have it downloaded, I can install the command on the path

```bash
cd ~/Downloads

sudo install k3d-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/k3d

```

Now it has been installed I can run to check 

```bash
k3d --version
```

This should give me the output;

```bash
k3d version v5.4.1
k3s version v1.22.7-k3s1 (default)
```
### Creating the first cluster

For the first cluster I am going to create it with the following parameters

- **Name:** first-cluster 
- **Servers:**  3 

To do this, I use the `cluster` sub command

```bash
k3d cluster create first-cluster --servers 3
```

This will give an output similar to this;

```bash
INFO[0000] Prep: Network

INFO[0010] Starting servers...

INFO[0031] Starting Node 'k3d-first-cluster-server-2'   
INFO[0047] All agents already running.                  
INFO[0047] Starting helpers...

INFO[0054] Injecting records for hostAliases (incl. host.k3d.internal) and for 4 network members into CoreDNS configmap... 
INFO[0056] Cluster 'first-cluster' created successfully! 
INFO[0056] You can now use it like this:                
kubectl cluster-info
```

Within just under a minute I have my first cluster up and running, I can list the clusters to see its running with the `cluster list` sub command

```bash
k3d cluster list
```
The output tells me that there are 3 servers running;

```bash
NAME            SERVERS   AGENTS   LOADBALANCER
first-cluster   3/3       0/0      true
```

Now that the cluster is running I can use `kubectl` to get some more information about the cluster

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
```

which should give similar output to this;

```
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://0.0.0.0:38909
CoreDNS is running at https://0.0.0.0:38909/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
Metrics-server is running at https://0.0.0.0:38909/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/https:metrics-server:https/proxy
```

I know that I have 3 nodes - so lets get some inforamtion about them too

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

This will give me an output similar to this;

```bash
NAME                         STATUS   ROLES                       AGE   VERSION
k3d-first-cluster-server-0   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   15m   v1.22.7+k3s1
k3d-first-cluster-server-1   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   15m   v1.22.7+k3s1
k3d-first-cluster-server-2   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   14m   v1.22.7+k3s1
```

The last step in this bootstrapping post is to check I can run a container - so I'm going to do a basic command to run a new pod called `nginx` using the `nginx` image


```bash
kubectl run nginx --image nginx
```

which hopefully should give me some output letting me know my pod has been created

```bash
pod/nginx created
```

A pod is the smallest instance of compute that can be deployed. A pod can contain a number of containers if their purpose is tightly coupled; an example might be a pod with a cache container that has another short life container required to pre-populate.

I can check the status of the pod using `kubectl`

```bash
kubectl describe pod nginx
```

Which will give me a verbose output about the pod

```bash

  Normal  Started    5m27s  kubelet            Started container nginx
```

I can see from this that the pod was deployed on `server-2` and pulled the latest `nginx` image before successfully starting

### Cleaning Up

Now that I know that everything seems to be okay, I can tear it all down before starting to do something more useful in the next blog post.


First lets stop the `nginx` pod

```bash 
kubectl delete pod nginx
```

Then I can stop the cluster

```bash
k3d cluster stop first-server

INFO[0000] Stopping cluster 'first-cluster'             
INFO[0011] Stopped cluster 'first-cluster' 
```

I am going to keep the cluster for the next blog, but I can now remove it if I wish using 

```bash
k3d cluster delete first-cluster

INFO[0000] Deleting cluster 'first-cluster'             
INFO[0000] Deleting cluster network 'k3d-first-cluster'
