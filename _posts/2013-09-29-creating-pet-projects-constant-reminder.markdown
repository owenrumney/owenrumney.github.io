title: Creating pet projects and the Constant Reminder
---

Now I've got into the Azure platform I've decided to start making the most of the MSDN voucher I get for free credits.
, I am a serial "new project" creator, some of these projects make it as far as being interesting to look at and some don't. Rather than hosting them on a hugely underutilised and time/effort intensive 1&1 VPS, I've decided to host them under Azure. This is not least because I can deploy pretty much anything I would want to without the overhead of configuring it.

So, to start with... there is constant reminder...

## Constant Reminder

### Overview

Constant reminder is a Chrome only web application to leverage the notification functionality provided in the Chrome browser.

Once notifications have been activated using the link at the top of the page, you can create time specific or interval based reminders. For example [Drink some water every 45mins](http://constantreminder.pet-projects.co.uk/?r=Drink+some+water&w=e&e=45&i=mins)
