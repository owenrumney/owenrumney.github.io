    <h2>SFTP Connection Closed - password expired?</h2>
    <p>11 Jul 2014 - Owen Rumney</p>
</div>

<div class="post-content">
<p>I’ve just had an interesting problem with an SFTP account that suddenly stopped working from a cron job. When the account was used directly from the bash prompt the response was simply Connection closed immediately.</p>

<p>Every thing was set up correctly as far as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authorized_keys</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> looked fine but the account wouldn’t connect.</p>

<p>As I don’t have the private key for the user that was connecting to the server, I created a new key pair and added the public key to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">authorized_keys</code> file in the users .ssh folder. Using the following command I got a response that was no more helpful;</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>psftp logdrop@10.0.0.1 -i logdrop_pk.ppk
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This gave the response;</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>FATAL: Recieved unexpected end-of-file from SFTP Server
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After a couple more checks on the server and no success I decided to try</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>putty logdrop@10.0.0.1 -i logdrop_pk.ppk
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This opened putty which connected but reported that the password for the user had expired and needed a new one. From here I was able to reset the password then go on the server and set</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>passwd -x 0 logdrop
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to ensure that the aging was deactivated.</p>

<p>So an interesting issue for a Friday afternoon.</p>
